This is a simple library to help testing Yeti modules using Yeti as the language to write tests.
Tests get executed by JUnit so that JUnit reports can be generated (including reports generated by maven surefire plugin).

To create tests, you need to:

1. Write one (or more) Yeti module that returns a hash<string, () -> ()>; each entry is one unit test with its name. When one test is executed, if it doesn't throw any exception, then it is reported as successful.

2. Write a Yeti module that just defines a Java class (the test suite) as follows:

	module package.module;
	
	{suiteFromModule} = load yeti.testutils;
	
	import junit.framework.TestCase;
	import junit.framework.TestSuite;
	
	class MyTestSuite extends TestCase
		static TestSuite suite()
			suiteFromModule load package.testmodule
	end

Your Yeti test modules can also load the "assertions" module that can help you write your test functions.
